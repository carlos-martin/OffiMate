# OffiMate

OffiMate is an App that was thought and designed by and for coworkers -people that share an office-.

The main idea is have a simple communication channel through which coworkers could communicate to each others. Coworkers would create channels with specific topic and have a chat inside, also the could send boost card to each others.
